# File Scanner

This is a quick file scanner written in TypeScript using Bun. It scans a directory for files and prints their names and sizes.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts <directory>
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.2.2. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
